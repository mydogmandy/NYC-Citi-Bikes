# NYC Citi Bike Analysis
## An analysis of an NYC bike sharing business
### Arguement for starting the business in Des Moines, IA

- The analysis begins with an initial comparison of gender demographics.  The NYC data shows Des Moines has much more potential for growth in relation to size.
- Citi Bikes have rental start-times all throughout the day, peaking from 4-7:00 pm.  Any maintenance required or scheduled can be performed between 2-5:00 am.
- As the age gets younger, utilization goes up.  The peak users fall into the 18 year old range, which is 1/4 the Des Moines population.
- The top start & stop locations with 10,000 or more rides are concentrated in the same general area.
- By comparing the concentrations of McDonalds restaurants to NYC, Des Moines can also be a success.  
- There is already a competing bike rental company in Des Moines, but they follow set routes, where Citi Bikes can be ridden anywhere.
